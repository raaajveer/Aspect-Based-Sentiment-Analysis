-	I have created a machine learning pipeline using python, where the input is the csv file of the user reviews
-	the output received is:
  •	Most mentioned aspects by the user.
  •	Word cloud indicating the positive, neutral and negative aspects based on the reviews by the user.
-	Using this machine learning pipeline, organizations can get insights such as which feature (aspect) to improve to acquire more user engagement which in turn helps acquire a larger market share.

Here, "absa.ipynb" is the main file which contains the machine learning pipeline.
      The rest of the files are supporting image files which are used to give background color to WordClouds.
      Sample CSV file - https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/datafiniti/hotel-reviews

NOTE :> When using this pipeline, make sure to edit the first cell according to your csv file columns.
        In my case, the name of my csv file is "reviews.csv" and the column containing the textual content is "reviews.text".
